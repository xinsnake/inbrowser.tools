    <h2>Why this site?</h2>
    <p class="center">
      Simply because I don't trust other online tools, especially
      those that send data to the server to process.
      They may be storing the data I send to them.
    </p>
    <p class="center">
      Whereas here, everything happens in <em>your browser</em>, and never leave your browser.
    </p>
    <p class="center">
      No ads, no tracking, no anything, just the bare minimum needed to make the tool useful.
